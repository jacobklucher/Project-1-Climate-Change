# Project-1-Climate-Change

## Project Description:

This project aims to visualize the impact of climate change on global temperatures, sea level rise, and weather patterns. We will create interactive and informative visualizations that communicate complex climate patterns and insights to answer the following questions: How have sea levels risen over time? And how has extreme weather events changed in frequency and intensity? Using a series of maps or charts showing the frequency and intensity of hurricanes, droughts, floods, and heatwaves can be used to answer these questions. A line chart or a map showing the rate of sea level rise in different regions can be used to visualize this.
