**Project 1 Proposal_Climate Change.docx** is our proposal document detailing our 

The *Climate Change* folder contains the **Climate_Change.ipynb** file used to clean up datasets and obtain analysis on the extracted data as well as the *Resources* folder and *output_data* folder.
+ The *Resources* folder contains all the csv files used to import the data for our datasets.
+ The *output_data* folder contains all of the visualization outputs created in the **Climate_Change.ipynb* file.

## Project Description:

This project aims to visualize the impact of climate change using global temperatures, sea levels, and CO2 emissions. Using our collected datasets, we have created informative visualizations that communicate the relationship between the change in temperature, sea levels, and CO2 emissions from 1880 to 2020 and answer the following questions: What is the current state of global warming and climate change? How much has the Earth's average temperature increased since the pre-industrial era? How much has sea level risen in the past century? How much has CO2 emissions changed over the years?
